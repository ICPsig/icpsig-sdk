# ICPsig-sdk

Software Development Kit for ICPsig

## USAGE


Here are the core functionalities of the ICPSig SDK for managing multi-signature (multisig) wallets:

- Connect Address: This feature allows users to connect to a specific address, presumably for authentication or authorization purposes.
Add address to Address Book: Developers can utilise this functionality to add addresses to the address book, making it easier to manage and interact with multisig wallets associated with those addresses.

- Remove address from Address Book: This feature enables the removal of addresses from the address book when they are no longer needed or relevant.
Create Multisig: With this functionality, developers can create new multisig wallets principals, which typically require multiple signatures for transaction authorization.

- Get Multisig Data by Address: This feature allows developers to retrieve information and data associated with a specific multisig wallet using its address.

- Get Transactions for Multisig: Developers can use this functionality to obtain a list of transactions associated with a particular multisig wallet.

- Get Assets for Multisig Address: This feature enables the retrieval of assets or tokens held within a multisig wallet using its address.

- Get Multisig Queue: This functionality likely provides information about the pending transaction queue or the status of transactions awaiting approval within a multisig wallet.

- Rename Multisig: This feature allows developers or users to rename a multisig wallet for better identification or organisation.

- Delete Multisig: Developers can utilise this functionality to delete or remove a multisig wallet that is no longer needed.

- Edit Multisig: This functionality enables developers to modify the configuration or settings of a multisig wallet, such as the required number of signatures or authorised participants.

Transfer Funds: With this functionality, developers can initiate the transfer of funds or assets from a multisig wallet to another address.

- Custom Transaction: This feature likely allows developers to create custom transactions for their multisig, which can manage and interact with multisig wallets on behalf of the owners.

- Approve Transaction: This feature allows authorised participants to approve or sign a pending transaction within a multisig wallet.
Cancel Transaction: This functionality enables the cancellation of a pending transaction within a multisig wallet before it gets finalised.
